<h2>Pozzarello</h2>
<p><a href="window.html"><img src="thumbnails/window_thumb.jpg" alt="view from the bedroom window" width="75" height="100"></a> The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the year 1200 as the home of the gardner who tended the grounds of the adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us nice and cool inside, despite the blistering mid-day heat. This is the view from our bedroom window.</p>

<h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>
<p><a href="countryside.html"><img src="thumbnails/countryside_thumb.jpg" alt="view of the coutryside" width="100" height="75"></a>This is the scene on the way to Montalcino (all roads lead to Montalcino!). It looks a lot like the scene on the way to Sienna, and the scene on the way to the grocery store. We were surrounded by beautiful countryside for most of our travels.</p>

<h2>Sienna</h2>
<p><a href="sienna.html"><img src="thumbnails/sienna_thumb.jpg" alt="the streets of sienna" width="75" height="100"></a>The closest city to our villa was Sienna, about 30 minutes away. We spent many days exploring the steep and crooked streets, sampling the local cuisine at outdoor restaurants, and stopping in the dark and echoey Duomo to escape the sun.</p>

<h2>cathedral</h2>
<p><a href="cathedral.html"><img src="thumbnails/cathedral_thumb.jpg" alt="this is the place were you can pray and have a piece of mind" width="75" height="100"></a>This is the home of our loving God here we can find the true piece and you can clear your mind and you can forget all of your problem. </p>

<h2> lavander </h2>
<p><a href="lavender.html"><img src="thumbnails/lavender_thumb.jpg" alt="view of the lavender" width="75" height="100"></a>The view of the lavender is good in the eye and when the brezze of the air is very aromatic because of the fresh lavender in your front of window.</p>

<h2> Sweets </h2>
